# Description

OOP game built with web technologies (html, css, javascript)

# How to play

Move player with arrow keys :)

# Demo

coming soon...

# To-Do

- [ ] Drop obstacles in random positions

# Further Improvements

Fix:

- [ ] remove obstacles as they go outside board
- [ ] prevent player from going outside

Functionality:

- shooting (recommended)
- drop different things (prizes, different types of obstacles...)
- count points
- improve game over
- levels (ex. increasing speed as user moves to the next level)
- multiple lives
- allow moving the player up and down
- random sizes for obstacles

UX:

- add images or textures/gradients (background, player, obstacles...)
- sound

Code quality:

- avoid repeating code for Player and Obstacle class (apply OOP inheritance)
- settings (speed of the game, distance between obstacles)
